Vector and ArrayList are both data structures used to store collections of elements. However, there are several differences between them:

1 - Syntax: Vector is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is defined in the java.util package, while ArrayList is also a part of the Java Collections Framework and is defined in the java.util package.

2 - Thread Safety: Vector is synchronized, meaning that multiple threads can access it safely, whereas ArrayList is not synchronized, meaning that only one thread can access it at a time. This means that if you need to access a collection from multiple threads, you should use a Vector.

3 - Performance: ArrayList is faster than Vector because ArrayList is not synchronized, whereas Vector is slower due to its synchronization overhead.

4 - Resizing: Both Vector and ArrayList can grow dynamically as elements are added, but Vector grows its size by doubling its current size, while ArrayList grows its size by 50% of its current size.

5 - Timeline: Vector was introduced in the first version of Java and was part of the original java.util package. ArrayList was introduced in Java 2 and is a more recent addition to the Java Collections Framework.

In general, if you don't need synchronization and need a fast collection, you should use ArrayList, while if you need synchronization, you should use Vector.



There are two ways to create a Synchronized ArrayList. 

1. Collections.synchronizedList() method. 

List<String> list =
           Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<String>());

synchronized(list)
        {
            // must be in synchronized block
            Iterator it = list.iterator();
 
            while (it.hasNext())
                System.out.println(it.next());
        }

2. Using CopyOnWriteArrayList.

CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> threadSafeList
            = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<String>();
// Iterating on the synchronized ArrayList using iterator.
       Iterator<String> it = threadSafeList.iterator();
